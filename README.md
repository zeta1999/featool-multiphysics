[System Requirements](https://www.featool.com/doc/quickstart.html#prereq)
-------------------

The _FEATool Multiphysics_ toolbox is a fully integrated simulation
environment for use with MATLAB®. _FEATool_ has been tested and
verified to work with 64-bit Windows, Mac OSX, and Linux operating
systems running MATLAB versions 7.9 (R2009b) and later. Furthermore,
a system with a minimum of 4 GB RAM memory is recommended.


[Installation](https://www.featool.com/doc/quickstart.html#install)
------------

In order to use the _FEATool Multiphysics_ toolbox it must first be
installed on the intended computer system. The toolbox can be
installed from the MATLAB® APPS and Add-On Toolbar, or downloaded
directly from the [Precise Simulation GitHub repository](https://github.com/precise-simulation/featool-multiphysics/releases/latest)
and installed manually.

Please follow the steps below for your matching system to install
_FEATool_ as a MATLAB toolbox. It is recommended to first [uninstall](https://www.featool.com/doc/quickstart.html#uninstall)
previous versions of toolboxes before installing/upgrading to a
newer version. Also note that, as all functionality is loaded into
memory at startup, the toolbox may take some time to fully initialize
and launch the GUI.

### MATLAB 2012b and later

1) First download the latest [FEATool Multiphysics.mlappinstall](https://github.com/precise-simulation/featool-multiphysics/raw/master/FEATool%20Multiphysics.mlappinstall)
   toolbox installation file (if you have downloaded a _zip_ archive
   instead, then extract the _mlappinstall_ file from inside it).

2) Then start MATLAB, press the **APPS** toolbar button,
   and select the **Install App** button.

3) When prompted to choose a toolbox file to install, select the
   **FEATool Multiphysics.mlappinstall** file and press **OK**.

4) Press the **Install** button if prompted to _"Install to My Apps"_.

Once the toolbox has been installed, an app icon will be available in
the _APPS_ toolbar to start the _FEATool_ GUI. (Note that MATLAB may
not show or give any indication of the toolbox installation progress
or completion.)

### MATLAB 2009b-2012a

1) First download the latest [FEATool Multiphysics zip archive](https://github.com/precise-simulation/featool-multiphysics/archive/master.zip)
   and extract it to a convenient folder on your system.

2) Start MATLAB in this folder, or change to the folder location in
   the MATLAB CLI interpreter with the command
   `cd path_to_featool_program_folder`

3) Run the command `start_featool_gui` from the FEATool program folder
   to start the GUI.

For convenience, one can also use the `addpath path_to_featool_program_folder`
command to permanently add the FEATool program folder to the MATLAB
search paths (one can then start FEATool from any location).


[Tutorials and Examples](https://www.featool.com/doc/quickstart.html#tutorials_and_examples)
----------------------

Pre-defined automated modeling tutorials and examples for various
multi-physics applications can be selected and run from the
          **File** > **Model Examples and Tutorials**
menu option in the GUI.

Example script files and simulation models are also available in the
                       [_examples folder_](https://github.com/precise-simulation/featool-multiphysics/tree/master/examples)
of the _FEATool_ program directory. Moreover, new tutorials and
articles are periodically published on the [FEATool Technical Articles Blog](https://www.featool.com/articles)


[Basic Use](https://www.featool.com/doc/quickstart.html#qs_work)
---------

_FEATool Multiphysics_ and the GUI has been specifically designed to
be as easy to use as possible, and making learning multiphysics
simulation by experimentation possible.

The standard modeling process is divided into six different steps or modes

- **Geometry** - Definition of the geometry to be modeled
- **Grid**     - Subdivision of the geometry into smaller grid cells
                 suitable for computation
- **Equation** - Specification of physics, material parameters, and coefficients
- **Boundary** - Boundary conditions specify how the model interacts
                 with the surrounding environment (outside of the geometry)
- **Solve**    - Solution and simulation of the defined model problem
- **Post**     - Visualization and postprocessing of simulation results

These modes can be accessed by clicking on the corresponding buttons
in left hand side _Mode_ toolbar. Each mode has specialized and
different _Tools_ available in the toolbar that will be activated when
selected. Additional and advanced mode options are also be available
in the mode menus.

Basic usage and how to set up and model fluid flow past an obstacle
is explained in the [linked video tutorial](https://youtu.be/ZnnXl7ryBMI)
