{"meta":{"app":"FEATool Multiphysics","author":"Precise Simulation","build":"1.9.1","date":"20-Jan-2019","descr":["The classic Poisson equation is one of the most fundamental partial differential equations (PDEs). Although one of the simplest equations, it is a very good model for the process of diffusion and comes up again and again in many applications such as in fluid flow, heat transfer, and chemical transport.","","This example shows how to set up and solve the Poisson equation for a scalar field _u = u(x)_ on a circle with radius _r = 1_. The diffusion coefficient _D = 1_ and right hand side source term _f = delta(0,0)_ which prescribes a point source at the center. The Poisson problem is also considered stationary meaning that time dependent term can be neglected.","","Moreover, homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions are prescribed on all boundaries of the domain, that is _u = 0_ on the boundary. The exact solution for this problem is _u(x,y) = -1/(2*pi)*log( r )_ and can be used to measure the accuracy of the computed solution."],"dim":2,"image":"poisson_point1.jpg","keyw":["quickstart","pde","point_source","validation"],"mlver":"R2019a","name":"poisson_point1","phys":["Poisson Equation"],"system":"","time":737445,"title":"Poisson Equation with a Point Source","type":"Classic PDE","user":"precsim","ver":[1,9,1]},
